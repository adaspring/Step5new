  "BLOCK_50_S1": "These expressive figures, often with detailed hairstyles and pierced features, reveal a rich cultural and symbolic tradition.",
  "BLOCK_50_S2": "Technical studies reveals the use of refined clay, controlled firing, and hollow modeling techniques.",
  "BLOCK_50_S3": "Dating back to 1500 century BCE and 500 century CE, the Nok terracotta sculptures are among the earliest known examples of three-dimensional figurative art not just in sub-Saharan Africa, but in Africa as a whole.",
  "BLOCK_51_S1": "Show more...",
  "BLOCK_52_S1": "They are originated from central Nigeria surrounding the village of Nok, the northern Nigerian states of Katsina and Sokoto and nearby sites.",
  "BLOCK_52_S2": "They precede other art traditions like the Ife bronzes (12th–15th century CE) and Benin bronzes (13th century CE onward).",
  "BLOCK_52_S3": "Their discovery reshaped global understanding of Africa’s ancient civilizations and artistic heritage.",
  "BLOCK_52_S4": "The objects came from an area that had no significant controlled archaeological excavation until Professor Peter Breunig and his team began their digs in 2005, in the Nok region, in collaboration with Nigerian archaeologists.",
  "BLOCK_52_S5": "The other areas, Sokoto and Katsina, still await archaeological excavation, although they are heavily pockmarked by local, amateur treasure hunters.",
  "BLOCK_52_S6": "Consequently, we know almost nothing about the cultures that created these works of art.",

  "BLOCK_55_S1": "Yale University Art Gallery",
  "BLOCK_56_S1": "About lecture",
  "BLOCK_57_S1": "After decades of limited research following the foundational work of Bernard Fagg in the mid-20th century, Professor Breunig and his team brings to light the results of fieldwork initiated in 2005.",
  "BLOCK_58_S1": "Show more...",
  "BLOCK_59_S1": "His long-term archaeological project, conducted in close collaboration with Nigerian institutions, has transformed our understanding of Nok culture.",
  "BLOCK_59_S2": "Unlike earlier studies that relied heavily on looted artifacts and surface finds, Breunig's work emphasizes contextual excavation, radiocarbon dating, and interdisciplinary analysis, placing Nok culture within a broader narrative of African prehistory.",
  "BLOCK_60_S1": "Grae's collection",
  "BLOCK_61_S1": "The Grae's Collection",
  "BLOCK_62_S1": "of Nok terracottas, is the most important and extensive of authentic ancient Nigerian art outside Nigeria.",
  "BLOCK_62_S2": "Donated to Yale, adds a layer of historical depth, revealing how artifacts tied to anti-colonial movements and Black diaspora activism entered the Western institutions.",
  "BLOCK_63_S1": "Show more...",
  "BLOCK_64_S1": "Collected by civil rights leader Bayard Rustin during Nigeria’s independence era, these ancient sculptures—preserved unrestored—reflect a legacy of cultural reclamation and solidarity.",
  "BLOCK_64_S2": "The collection serves as a vital resource for scholars and students, offering deep insights into early African art and culture.",
  "BLOCK_64_S3": "The essay highlights this unique provenance, challenging colonial narratives and reframing how collections are understood: not as detached relics, but as testaments to activism, identity, and ethical responsibility.",
